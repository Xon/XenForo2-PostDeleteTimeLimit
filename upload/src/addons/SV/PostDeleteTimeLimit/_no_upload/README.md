# PostDeleteTimeLimit

Permission to limit how old a post/thread can be and still be deleted, separate from the stock XenForo edit time window permission.

As XenForo doesn't handle deleting posts from super-long threads well

Introduces 1 new permissions:

- Time limit on deleting own messages (minutes)

Note; delete any post will bypass this permission.
